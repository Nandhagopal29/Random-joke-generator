# Random-joke-generator

A simple project to generate random jokes, which tests my understanding of the REST API and Javascript.

It has four buttons, namely Speaker, Copy, Twitter, and New Joke. Each button has its own functionality. New Joke will generate a new joke for each press, and if you click the speaker button, it will utter the currently generated joke.

Copy will copy the joke into the clipboard, and the Twitter icon will make the joke ready to tweet. Once you click the tweet button on Twitter, the joke will get tweeted.
